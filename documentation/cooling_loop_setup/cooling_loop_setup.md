## Instructions for setting-up the cold-stage recirculating cooling-loop.

## 1. Introduction:

Operation of the solid-state cold-stage requires a continuous supply of coolant media held at ~ +5 deg C. This coolant media acts as a heat source/sink that supplies heat to- or removes heat rejected by the peltier thermoelectric element that forms the active heat-pump within the cold-stage.

It is recommended that a laboratory recirculating chiller system is used for this purpose, connected to the cold-stage in a closed-loop as shown in it's simplest form in Fig. 1.

## 2. Cooling-loop requirements:

### i. Cooling media:

Consult the documentation provided by the recirculating chiller manufacturer for recommended coolant media. 

As a guideline, the coolant media must have a freezing point below the coldest part of the chiller mechanism, which can be as low as around - 30 deg C. This can be achieved using standard ethylene glycol anti-freeze ...

### ii. Fluid couplers:

Each cold stage is fitted with two locking hose coupling bodies at the front of the instrument. These mate with corresponding coupling inserts

### iii. Fluid valves:

### iv. Cooling capacity (power):

Multiple cold-stages can be connected to a single recirculating chiller, limited by it's total cooling-capacity. Though the heat rejected by a single cold-stage will depend on it's operating condition and applied thermal loads, as a guideline allow ~XXX W of cooling capacity per 30 mm cold-stage or ~XXX W of cooling capacity per 52 mm cold-stage respectively.

If the recirculating chiller is not able to hold the bulk coolant media at or around 5 deg C during cold-stage operation, it indicates that the chosen recirculating chiller does not provide adequate cooling capacity for the desired cold-stage configuration.

### v. Coolant flow-rate:

A coolant flow-rate of ~

## 3. Recommended system configuration:

### i. Single cold-stage:

### ii. Two cold-stages:
